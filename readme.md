## What is Microsoft’s perspective on open source? ##

Microsoft is open to open source. More and more, customers, partners and the industry understand that the work we are doing with open source is about helping customers and enabling a rich and robust ecosystem of developers and partners. We enable open source on our platforms and encourage open source developers to continue to think of Windows and Windows Phone as platforms for them to develop on. 

## What is Microsoft’s open source strategy? ##

Our open source strategy is grounded in the recognition that interoperability is a lever for growth. This involves working to make Windows the platform of choice for customers and developers through enabling open source applications to run better on and with Windows platforms. We are working with many open source communities to identify valuable opportunities to participate in projects and initiatives, focusing on improved open source application interoperability with our products, and utilizing an open source development approach or open source software if it makes sense for specific products and solutions.

## How has Microsoft evolved its overall strategy regarding open source? ##

Our open source strategy has evolved based on an increased technical expertise, dialogue with our customers, many of whom operate heterogeneous environments with traditional commercial software, commercial open source software and community-based open source software working side-by-side, appreciation for both how the open source development model can be applied to our own software development, and the potential for Microsoft technologies to be great platforms for open source applications. 

We are much clearer today on where the company competes with commercial Linux offerings and specific products that happen to be open source, and where it cooperates with open source communities and interoperates with open source applications to meet the needs of shared customers. Cooperation and competition have always existed in the IT industry, and open source does not change that.

## You talk so much about openness and collaboration with open source. Are you saying MS is not going to be a proprietary software company anymore? Will the company ever open its entire technology stack?  [This question is usually asked as When will you open source Windows?] ##

No. We are passionate about our business model, which has allowed us to do a great deal for our customers, both helping connect the world and spread innovation, and making it possible for individuals and businesses to operate the way they do today.  Even though our own core products are not open source, we are increasingly looking for areas where we and open source communities can cooperate and complement one another, since that is good for us, and good for our customers.

## There is a perception that Microsoft shifts gears on open source frequently, with a sense of schizophrenia on patent issues and competitive marketing campaigns. How do we know the overall strategy isn’t going to change tomorrow? ##

Our open source strategy has evolved based on an increased technical expertise, dialogue with our customers, many of whom operate heterogeneous environments with traditional commercial software, commercial open source software and community-based open source software working side-by-side, appreciation for both how the open source development model can be applied to our own software development, and the potential for Microsoft technologies to be great platforms for open source applications. That said, we need to stay grounded in the fact that our participation in open source communities does not preclude the fact that we still compete with some open source applications, particularly Linux, just as we compete with some other closed sourced vendors and just as Linux vendors compete with each other. 

## What is Microsoft’s perspective on Linux? ##
We compete with commercial distributions of the Linux operating system, just as we compete with other operating systems and just as Linux vendors compete with each other. Customers who are operating in heterogeneous technology environments that include Linux continue to look for ways to get more value for money so they can focus resources on staying competitive. So, while we believe that manageability, ease of use, choice of applications, and availability of skills to support make Microsoft platforms the best choice, our goal for these customers is to help them to reduce complexity and achieve greater manageability. This commitment is evident in our partnership with Novell, and the recent contribution of device drivers to the Linux community to enhance the performance of all Linux distributions on Hyper-V. 

## Why was Microsoft Open Technologies created? ##
Microsoft created Microsoft Open Technologies, Inc., to advance Microsoft’s investment in openness – including interoperability, open standards and open source.  While Microsoft and its business groups will continue to engage with the open source and open standards communities in a variety of ways, the subsidiary provides a new way of engaging in a more clearly defined manner. This new structure helps facilitate the interaction between Microsoft’s proprietary development processes and the company’s open innovation efforts and relationships with open source and open standards communities. We are always looking at ways to better serve developers, customers and partners in mixed IT environments. As interest in interoperability and open source has grown and matured, the company looked at new ways to respond. Microsoft Open Technologies is a further demonstration of Microsoft’s long-term commitment to interoperability, greater openness, and to working with open source communities. 

## What is Microsoft’s position on standards? ##
Microsoft supports thousands of standards in its products and actively participates in more than 150 standards organizations and working groups worldwide. We’re participating in the process to help create useful, open ICT industry standards. Standards are a fundamentally collaborative exercise and we recognize the strategic value of constructive standards engagements for our products and our customers. When an industry chooses to widely implement a standard, it can help provide choice, respond to customer needs and level the playing field, not pick winners or losers. Our products support a long list of standards, helping to facilitate interoperability with other products that also implement those standards.
